## Add category
Aspire Budget makes it very easy to add a category. To make life super easy, I've added a button that does all the copy pasting of rows for you. Add a category at any position in your configuration screen.

## Rename category
Renaming a category requires you to change the name in various places. This can become painful and very repetitive. The name needs to change in the configuration tab, the category transfer and transactions tabs, and all report tabs. I've added a button that does all that and follows Aspire Budget's documentation to the dot.

## Delete category
Deleting a category is relatively straight forward but can be distracting then you are following a train of thought or are in the middle of a conversation. Copy/pasting rows in the configuration screen and remembering to add the category to the hidden categories list. Instead, I've added a button that automates all lot of that.
